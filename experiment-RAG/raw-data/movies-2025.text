# Eddington (2025), directed and written by Ari Aster:

---

### What It’s About

Set in May 2020, during the early COVID‑19 pandemic and amid heated Black Lives Matter protests, Eddington is a *neo-Western satirical dark comedy* that transforms a small New Mexico town into a pressure cooker of political and social tension ([Wikipedia][1]).

Plot structure:

* Sheriff Joe Cross (Joaquin Phoenix), an anti-mask, libertarian local lawman, clashes with reelection-focused Mayor Ted Garcia (Pedro Pascal) over pandemic mandates ([The Daily Beast][2]).
* Deep-rooted personal and political grudges surface—including a personal betrayal involving Joe’s wife, Louise (Emma Stone), and past with Ted ([The Daily Beast][2]).
* Online conspiracies, escalating protests, and cult figures (like Austin Butler’s character) intervene, dividing the town into caricatured political extremes ([The Daily Beast][2]).

### Themes & Style

Ari Aster crafted the film as a satirical microcosm of America’s pandemic‑era fracture, skewering:

* Political polarization (both left and right extremes)
* Misinformation & social media radicalization
* Personal vendettas disguised as public crises

All styled with Aster’s trademark surreal, genre-blending flair—mixing absurdist comedy, psychological horror, and modern Western tropes ([The Daily Beast][2], [The Washington Post][3]).

### Tone & Reception

* Satirical yet caustic: Critics say Aster's film “is designed to provoke and leave audiences both laughing and uncomfortable” ([The Daily Beast][2]).
* Divisive critic response: Some applaud its bold confrontation of modern anxieties, while others criticize its chaotic, emotionally distant storytelling .
* Lengthy and intense: At around 148–149 minutes and rated R for violence and graphic content, it’s heavy on tension and occasional gore .

---

### Release & Accolades

* Premiered at Cannes on May 16, 2025, followed by wide U.S. theatrical release on July 18, 2025 ([Wikipedia][1]).
* Opened the Fantasia International Film Festival in Montreal on July 16, 2025 ([Wikipedia][4]).

---

### Should You Watch It?

* Expect a deliberately uncomfortable, satirical barometer of a divided society, not a cohesive drama or traditional horror.
* If you appreciated Aster’s trippy style in *Beau Is Afraid*, *Midsommar*, or *Hereditary*, this is right in his wheelhouse.
* But note: viewers seeking narrative clarity or emotional resolution may find it frustrating or overly chaotic.

---

TL;DR: *Eddington* is Ari Aster’s exaggerated, provocative satire of pandemic-era America—where split allegiances, conspiracies, and personal grudges explode in a small-town showdown. It’s bold, messy, and bound to piss people off... intentionally.

# Jurassic World: Rebirth (2025):

---

### What It’s About

Set five years after *Jurassic World Dominion*, the film follows covert‑ops expert Zora Bennett (Scarlett Johansson) who leads a mission to a remote equatorial island where surviving dinosaurs roam. Her team—paleontologist Dr. Henry Loomis (Jonathan Bailey), mercenary Duncan Kincaid (Mahershala Ali), and pharma exec Martin Krebs (Rupert Friend)—aim to collect DNA samples from three colossal creatures (land, sea, air) believed to unlock a new heart disease cure. A stranded civilian family complicates their mission, and they soon confront a horrifying mutant dinosaur, the six‑limbed Distortus rex ([Wikipedia][1], [Wikipedia][2]).

---

### Themes & Style

* Standalone fresh start: Departing from the legacy-heavy tone of recent sequels, it feels more like a tribute to Spielberg’s original — framed as a “heist meets Jaws/Indiana Jones” adventure .
* Practical effects focus: Director Gareth Edwards emphasized real locations and practical effects shot in Thailand and Malta to evoke old-school awe ([EW.com][3]).
* Creature design: The grotesque yet pitiable Distortus rex draws inspiration from *Alien* and *Star Wars* aesthetics ([Wikipedia][1]).

---

### Tone & Reception

* Mixed reviews: Critics appreciated the pioneering action and nostalgic nods, though some found the plot thin and characters two‑dimensional ([The Daily Aztec][4]).
* Score & music: Alexandre Desplat’s new score includes a clarinet solo by Jonathan Bailey himself—a rare actor‑performed moment recorded at Abbey Road ([Wikipedia][5]).
* Audience reaction: One critic called it “nauseatingly simple but fun” — a return to straight‑up dinosaur thrills, free of excessive fan-service ([Cinemablend][6]).
* Box‑office: Solid opening with \~\$11.4 M on second Friday in the U.S.; it’s currently roaring to roughly \$565 M worldwide on a \$180 M budget .

---

### Release & Accolades

* World premiere: June 17, 2025, at London’s Leicester Square; U.S. theatrical release on July 2, 2025 ([Wikipedia][2]).
* Stream & digital: Hitting digital platforms (e.g., rental/purchase) on August 5, 2025 .
* Soundtrack release: Full score by Desplat launched July 2, with vinyl edition following in October ([Wikipedia][5]).

---

### Should You Watch It?

* For original‑park nostalgia: If you missed the hostage‑style menace and wonder Spielberg-inspired storytelling, this delivers .
* For action fans: Packed with new dinosaur encounters and thrilling set-pieces—enjoyable if you’re here for monster‑movie fun .
* Caution: If you're looking for deep character arcs or tight writing, the plot may feel a bit shallow and overtly formulaic .

---

### TL;DR

A dinosaur‑heavy, nostalgia‑infused standalone chapter that ditches franchise callbacks for pure action. With flashy creature design, practical effects, and a fresh cast, it’s the most fun entry in a while—just don’t expect a richly layered story.

Four years after his explosive showdown with the Russian mob, Hutch Mansell (Bob Odenkirk) is still deep in debt—\$30 million to be exact—and making international hits to pay it off. Trying to reconnect with his wife Becca (Connie Nielsen) and their kids, he drags them and his father David (Christopher Lloyd) to a theme‑park vacation.
